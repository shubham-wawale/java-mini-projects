# Java Mini Projects

This repository contains five mini projects that showcase different concepts and functionalities in Java. These projects helped me strengthen my understanding of Java fundamentals, collections, data structures, UI development, and functional programming with streams. Each project focuses on a specific area, allowing me to explore and implement best practices in Java development.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Adventure Game
- **Concepts Used:** Collections (Lists, Maps, Sets), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Description:** A simple text-based adventure game where players can explore different locations and move around on the map. The game utilizes Maps to store locations and navigation paths.

### 2. Music App
- **Concepts Used:** JavaFX for UI development, Event Handling
- **Description:** A basic music application with a graphical interface built using JavaFX. Users can play, pause, and navigate through songs. This project helped me understand Java's UI development and event-driven programming.

### 3. Poker Game
- **Concepts Used:** Collections Framework, Data Structures (Lists, Maps, Queues)
- **Description:** A simplified poker game simulation that demonstrates the use of collections to manage and distribute playing cards efficiently.

### 4. Store Inventory Management
- **Concepts Used:** Maps, Sets, Object-Oriented Design
- **Description:** A mini application that helps manage a storeâ€™s inventory. This project uses Maps and Sets to store product details and ensure unique inventory records.

### 5. Student Engagement Statistics
- **Concepts Used:** Java Streams, Functional Programming
- **Description:** A statistics tool that processes student engagement data using Java Streams. It leverages functional programming principles to filter, map, and analyze data efficiently.

## My Learnings & Growth as a Java Developer

- **Mastery of Java Collections:** Through these projects, I gained a deep understanding of Lists, Sets, and Maps, learning how to choose the right data structures for different scenarios.
- **Hands-on Experience with JavaFX:** Implementing the Music App introduced me to UI development in Java, enhancing my ability to create interactive applications.
- **Functional Programming with Streams:** The Student Engagement Statistics project helped me apply Java Streams for efficient data processing.
- **Object-Oriented Design & Best Practices:** Every project reinforced key OOP principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.
- **Problem-Solving & Algorithmic Thinking:** Working on these projects enhanced my ability to solve problems efficiently using Java.

These projects collectively demonstrate my ability to design and implement real-world applications in Java, making me a well-rounded Java programmer with a strong grasp of both core and advanced concepts.
